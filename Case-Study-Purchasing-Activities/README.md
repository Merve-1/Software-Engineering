# Local Education Authority Procurement Analysis

This project is a case study on the purchasing activity of schools and colleges within the Pebbleshire County Councilâ€™s Education Department. The focus of this project was to create and organize the requirements for a new web-based application using Trello. No implementation was done; the project involved creating epics, user stories, assigning priorities, tasks, checklists, and setting deadlines.

## Project Overview

The case study investigates the current purchasing activities of educational institutions and outlines the requirements for an automated system. The main goal was to document the requirements in a structured manner using Trello.

### Epics

We identified major themes and larger bodies of work that needed to be broken down into smaller tasks. Each epic represents a significant feature or set of features required for the new system.

### User Stories

User stories were created to capture the functionality needed from the perspective of the end users. Each user story includes:
- **Title**: Brief description of the story
- **Description**: Detailed explanation of the requirement
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Conditions that need to be met for the story to be considered complete
- **Priority**: Assigned based on the importance and urgency

### Tasks and Checklists

Tasks were created for each user story to break down the work into manageable units. Checklists were used within tasks to ensure all necessary steps were completed.

### Priorities

Each user story and task were assigned a priority level:
- **High**: Critical for the initial implementation
- **Medium**: Important but not urgent
- **Low**: Can be deferred until later stages

### Deadlines

Deadlines were set for each task to manage time effectively and ensure timely completion of the project phases.
