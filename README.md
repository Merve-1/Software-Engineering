# Software Engineering Reference Repository

Welcome to the Software Engineering Reference Repository! This repository is designed as a resource for anyone starting in software engineering, with a focus on practical projects and real-world examples.

## Projects

### 1. **Local Education Authority Procurement Analysis**
   - **Description**: This project is a detailed case study on the purchasing activities of schools and colleges within the Pebbleshire County Councilâ€™s Education Department.
